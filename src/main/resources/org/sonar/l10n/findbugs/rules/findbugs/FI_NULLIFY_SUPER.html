<p> This empty <code>finalize()</code> method explicitly negates the
  effect of any finalizer defined by its superclass.&nbsp; Any finalizer
  actions defined for the superclass will not be performed.&nbsp;
  Unless this is intended, delete this method.</p>

This rule is deprecated, use {rule:squid:ObjectFinalizeOverridenCallsSuperFinalizeCheck}, {rule:squid:S1186} instead.
